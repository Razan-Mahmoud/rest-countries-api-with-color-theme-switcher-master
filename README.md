## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Bootstrap5
- jQuery
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned how to switch between light and dark themes using jQuery library. I also learned how to iterate through JSONs with changeable values, converting it into an array amd using the map() method, using the Object.values method. All in all, it was a great exercise.

Example of the object method:

```js
Object.values(objectName.objectInsideIt).map((e) => {
              return //some iterable code 
              })
```

### Useful resources

- [Vite React App with Routes Deployed on Github](https://youtu.be/uEEj2c3_ydg?feature=shared) - This helped me deploy the app on GitHub after finishing it, as I still struggle a bit with the Git methods. I really liked this video and I'm so grateful for it.
- [How to Use JSON Server for Front-end Development](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/json-server-for-frontend-development/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand JSON server and how to establish and use them. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
